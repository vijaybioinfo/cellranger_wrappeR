# Cell Ranger WrappeR

Welcome to the Vijay's Lab Cell Ranger wrapper based on R.

It is as easy as just running a line that will take care of assinging a job for each of your samples.


```markdown
cellranger_wrappeR -y /path/to/project/config.yaml -v
```

Then you can go do more fun coding and wait for your jobs to finish. When they do, you simply run the summary function.

```markdown
cellranger_wrappeR -y /path/to/project/config.yaml -s 
```
